# curriculum_learner_LTS  

Levin tree search guided by both a policy and a heuristic function
 
**Goal**: solve Witness puzzles using Levin Tree Search (LevinTS) in a way that generates a curriculum of puzzles.  

We compare the ordering of puzzles to Jonathan Blow's hand-crafted curriculum.  
 

### Step-by-step example:
Note: This code was generated with the intention of running on a ComputeCanada cluster.
1. Log into Compute Canada  
<pre><code> ssh cedar </code></pre>

#TODO: which dependencies do I need? How can I run this locally?

2. If you wish to run the Best-First Search (BFS) version of LevinTS, run:
<pre><code> sbatch ./FD_get_parameters_BFS.sh </code></pre>
Otherwise, if you wish to submit a job that runs the Depth-First Search (DFS) version of LevinTS:
<pre><code> sbatch ./FD_get_parameters_DepthFS.sh </code></pre>

3. Once the jobs are ready, you will find the results in the folders `solved_puzzles/` and `logs_large/`.   

### How to set up your experiment:
If using Compute Canada, in either of these bash scripts mentioned above, I set the following variables:
<pre><code>loss="CrossEntropyLoss"  --> loss function that you want to use.
algorithm="Levin"  --> search algorithm ("Levin" stands for Levin Tree Search)
domain_name="Witness"   --> domain of the puzzles
problems_dir="problems/witness/puzzles_4x4/"   --> directory where the puzzles are stored
size_puzzle="4x4"  --> dimensions of the puzzles
output="output_test_witness_4x4/"  --> directory where the outputs generated by sbatch are saved. These are generally .out files.
</code></pre>
I could also set other variables, such as `search_budget`, `gradient_steps`, etc. For the sake of my preliminary experiments, I kept these fixed.


### Structure of the repository:  
#### src 
This directory contains the most important code that you need to run.  
- `main.py` parses the parameters that you decided on, and runs the experiment

### 1. How to run the program:
